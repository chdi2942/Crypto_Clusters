# Crypto_Clusters

We will combine financial Python programming skills with unsupervised learning skills.

The CSV file provided contains price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

The steps are broken out into the following sections:

* Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results

Requirements
* Python 3.7
* Pandas
* HVPlot
* SKLearn

Conclusions
Using fewer features seemed to remove some outliers and cluster the data in a more meaningful way with less inertia.
